The goal of this script is to provide a way of storing Reddit data into a tree-like data structure. The previous iteration, RedditTreeGrab, relied on the shelve module and an earlier API version. This version should be much more efficient and easier to use for general querying.

For an example of previous work done using this type of data, see a course project I wrote a couple years ago: https://www.scribd.com/document/250044180/Analyzing-Political-Discourse-on-Reddit
